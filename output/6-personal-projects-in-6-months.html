    <p>I like the idea of Pieter Levels of launching 12 startups in 12 months very much. Many people have written about it:</p>
<p>2014 I'm Launching 12 Startups in 12 Months by Pieter Levels
2018 12 Startups in 12 Months by Jon Yongfook
2018 Why we're building 24 businesses in 12 months
2018 I'm Going to Launch 12 Startups in 12 Months
I want to change the challenge a little bit because I don't want to build 12 startups. Then I prefer to say that I want to build things. I have a job that occupies me most of the time. It's complicated to make something when you have a full-time job in a company. But if you don't want to take the risk of leaving your job, you have to sacrifice yourself, and you have to squeeze each minute of your free time.</p>
<p>My most significant challenge is to finish personal projects. I don't have any problem completing tasks in my job, but when I face to own projects the thing changes. I am very good at starting projects. Sometimes I finish a small project. The problem is that are projects of medium or big size that I struggle to finish. In which I have to be constant and continue until the end. This is my biggest challenge, to complete medium or large size projects. I think many times that the problem is these projects don't motivate myself.</p>
<p>Because of this, I am introducing 6 personal projects in 6 months. 6 projects that motivate me, that will create the habit of finishing tasks, that will improve my life, that will improve my skills, that could mark a turning point in my career</p>
<p>I'm going to write down some steps to begin to create my projects. These steps are aligned with my priorities.</p>
<p>Write down my priorities in life right now, as few as possible. Ideally, only 4 or 5.
Write down personal skills I want to improve. Like improve my English skills, be a complete programmer, improve my memory, improve my knowledge in A.I, …
Only Focus in One project at a time.
Make a list of things that motivated me to build the project. Five things that drive me a lot. Reasons I can look when a task gets stuck.
Make a plan beforehand. These include writing the tasks of the first two weeks with the timing for each task, resources time for each job. Reserve free time for backup.
Track my progress weekly.</p>
