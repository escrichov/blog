Hi! My name is Carlos. I'm a passionate software engineer with 5+ years of experience from ğŸ‡ªğŸ‡¸ Spain.

I like to design and create new systems that resolve real people problems. One of my strengths is that I donâ€™t take things for granted. I always try to know in-depth if what they tell me is true. And how things work internally.

**Why I write this blog?**

I want to change my career, building projects for my own ([indiehackers](https://www.indiehackers.com/) very inspired me). Building projects that have challenges. Challenges in which I love to work and solve problems that people have.

I want this blog to have all the progress in creating a sustainable project. That allows me to be my own boss. And that also serves as my motivation and that of other people.

**Interests and essential things in my life**

* Be healthy. Go Running, building up, having good eating habits, and make periodic medical checks.

* Travel the world ğŸ‡ªğŸ‡¸ğŸ‡«ğŸ‡·ğŸ‡®ğŸ‡¹ ğŸ‡©ğŸ‡ªğŸ‡¬ğŸ‡§ğŸ‡µğŸ‡¹ğŸ‡ºğŸ‡¸ğŸ‡µğŸ‡ª
* Never stop learning. Having a constant growth of my knowledge. Improve my social skills, my abilities

* Create new systems that solve people problems. Do not just program them.
* Cinema. I love watching good movies. [I maintain a list of all the movies that I like.](https://letterboxd.com/escrichov/likes/)
